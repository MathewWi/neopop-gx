Previous Unofficial Version release code changes updated into official SVN. Thanks Eke-Eke
Thanks emu_kidid for borrowed swiss WKF & IDE-EXI code

note about release version to avoid confusion:
  the last official release from eke-eke was dated 20/07/2007
  this was also the version release number v 070720 (date backwards)
  since this port is based on neopopUK SDL release version 0.71 and also
  since this is my second release of this emulator v.2, then put both numbers together:
  neopopUK v0.71
  GC/Wii   v   0.2
  -----------------
  equals   v0.71.2
  moving forward i request all official SVN releases follow this format.
  Thanks, megalomaniac
